      You are eligible for early release from prison on Home Detention Curfew (tagging).
    </p>
    <div class="subtitle">
      What this means for you
    </div>
    <p>
      This means you could be released from prison on <span data-th-text="${#temporals.format(currentAssessment.hdced, 'dd MMM yyyy')}">15 July 2026</span> if you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>behave well in prison; and</li>
      <li>have somewhere to live after you leave prison where you can be safely managed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are released early you would have to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>stay at home during certain house (your curfew); and</li>
      <li>wear an electronic tag - to make sure you follow your curfew.</li>
      <li>allow EMS provider staff access to your home to check the equipment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You would have a curfew and electronic tag until <span data-th-text="${#temporals.format(taggingEndDate, 'dd MMM yyyy')}"></span>
    </p>
    <div class="subtitle">
      What happens next
    </div>
    <p>
      Think about where you could live if you were released on <span data-th-text="${#temporals.format(currentAssessment.hdced, 'dd MMM yyyy')}">15-July-2026</span>.
      We will give you a form to fill in with the address details closer to the date you can be released on Home Detention Curfew.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can, think of a second address in case your first choice is not suitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't have a place to stay, the Community Accommodation Service Tier 2 (CAS2) could help you find somewhere.
      We will pass your details to CAS2 if you need it.`
