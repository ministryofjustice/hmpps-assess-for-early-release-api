<p>We checked to see if you're eligible for release from prison on Home Detention Curfew (tagging).</p>
<p>By law you are not eligible because <span>you will be subject to sex offender registration on release</span>.</p>
<p>You cannot challenge this because it is based on the law, not on a decision by prison staff.</p>
