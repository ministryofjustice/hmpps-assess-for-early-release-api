  What you need to know
</div>
<p>
  We previously told you that you're eligible for Home Detention Curfew (tagging).
</p>
<p>
  Under Home Detention Curfew you would have to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>stay at home during certain hours (your curfew); and</li>
  <li>wear an electronic tag - to make sure you follow your curfew</li>
  <li>allow EMS provider staff access to your home to check the equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It would mean you could be released on <span>((release_date))</span>.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">
  What you need to do now
</div>
<p>
  You now need to fill in the 'Address Form' and return it by <span>((address_form_due_date))</span>.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">
  What we will do
</div>
<p>
  We will:
</p>
<ul class="unindented-list">
  <li>Ask probation to check that the address you provided is suitable - this includes talking to anyone else who lives there.</li>
  <li>Assess any risks of release you on Home Detention Curfew to the proposed address.</li>
  <li>Let you know our final decision (in writing).</li>
</ul>
<div class="subtitle">
