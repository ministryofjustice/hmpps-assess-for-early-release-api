    We have checked the address you gave us and decided it is not a suitable place for you to live while under
    Home Detention Curfew (tagging).
  </p>
  <p>
    You need to provide details of another address where you could live if you still want to be considered for
    tagging.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cannot provide an address, Community Accommodation Service Tier 2 (CAS2) could help you find
    somewhere to stay.
